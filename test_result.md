# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITATION (not a bug): (10) Rate limit test failed — expected 429 after 5 failed login attempts, but got 401. Root cause: In Kubernetes load-balanced environment, requests are distributed across multiple backend pods (IPs 10.79.138.194 and 10.79.138.198 seen in logs), and the in-memory rate limiting (per-pod) doesn't accumulate properly. The rate limiting code is correct and unchanged (lines 103-108 in server.py), but doesn't work reliably in distributed environments. This is a known limitation of in-memory rate limiting in load-balanced setups, NOT a bug introduced by the auth fix. Recommendation: If rate limiting is critical for production, implement distributed rate limiting using Redis or similar shared state."

Try again in 14 minutes.' Correct credentials also blocked during lockout. Lockout window: 900 seconds (15 minutes). NOTE: Rate limiting works per-backend-pod (in-memory), so on load-balanced public URL it may take more attempts to trigger. On localhost (single instance) it works perfectly. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The most likely reason user sees 'invalid credentials' is (a) Rate limiting after multiple failed attempts - requires backend restart or 15-min wait to clear, (b) Copy-paste error with password (case-sensitive), or (c) Typing wrong password. Email case and whitespace are NOT issues (backend handles both). RECOMMENDATION: If user still reports issue, ask them to try: (1) Wait 15 minutes or ask admin to restart backend to clear rate limit, (2) Carefully re-type password 'admin123' (case-sensitive, no spaces), (3) Ensure no browser extensions interfering with login."

Tested the CORS/withCredentials fix where backend /api/auth/refresh now accepts refresh_token from either cookie OR JSON body, and frontend no longer uses withCredentials: true. RESULTS: 9/10 tests passed. All core auth flows working perfectly: login with correct/wrong credentials, refresh via body flow (new), refresh via cookie flow (legacy backward compatibility), missing token handling, invalid token handling, wrong token type handling, /auth/me with Bearer token, and Phase 2 endpoints regression check. The one failed test (rate limiting) is an environmental limitation in Kubernetes load-balanced setup where in-memory rate limiting doesn't work reliably across multiple pods — NOT a bug in the auth fix. The rate limiting code is unchanged and correct. Recommendation: If rate limiting is critical, implement distributed rate limiting using Redis."
